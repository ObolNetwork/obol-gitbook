# Introduction to the Obol Stack

The Obol Stack is a local development environment for running AI agents alongside blockchain infrastructure. It provides a simplified CLI for managing a Kubernetes cluster with an AI agent ([OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)), dynamically deployable blockchain networks, and public access via Cloudflare tunnels.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Obol Stack is alpha software. For production deployments, refer to the respective network documentation and use appropriate infrastructure.
{% endhint %}

## What is the Obol Stack?

Obol Stack is a two-part system:

1. **obolup.sh** - A bootstrap installer that sets up your environment
2. **obol CLI** - A Go-based binary for stack, agent, and network management

The stack runs entirely on your local machine using [k3d](https://k3d.io/) (Kubernetes in Docker), providing a lightweight yet fully-featured Kubernetes environment.

## Key features

* **Agent-first** - Deploy an AI agent (OpenClaw) that can interact with blockchain networks and expose services.
* **Multiple network support** - Deploy Ethereum nodes, Aztec sequencers, and more.
* **Unique deployments** - Each installation creates a uniquely-namespaced deployment, allowing multiple instances to run simultaneously.
* **Public access** - Expose services to the internet via Cloudflare tunnels and x402 payment gateways.
* **Simplified tooling** - Wraps kubectl, helm, and other Kubernetes tools with automatic configuration.

## CLI overview

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `obol stack init / up / down / purge` | Cluster lifecycle management |
| `obol agent init` | Set up the AI agent (OpenClaw) |
| `obol openclaw dashboard / setup / ...` | Manage OpenClaw instances |
| `obol model setup / status` | Configure LLM providers |
| `obol network list / install / sync / delete` | Manage blockchain networks |
| `obol app install / sync / list / delete` | Install arbitrary Helm charts |
| `obol tunnel status / login / provision` | Manage Cloudflare tunnels |
| `obol kubectl / helm / k9s` | Kubernetes tool passthroughs |

## Default infrastructure

When you start the stack, the following services are deployed automatically:

| Service | Namespace | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Traefik** | `traefik` | Gateway API ingress controller |
| **Cloudflared** | `traefik` | Cloudflare tunnel connector |
| **ERPC** | `erpc` | Unified RPC load balancer for Ethereum endpoints |
| **Obol Frontend** | `obol-frontend` | Web management dashboard |
| **Monitoring** | `monitoring` | Prometheus + kube-prometheus-stack |
| **llmspy** | `llm` | LLM proxy/router for AI agent traffic |

## System requirements

### Prerequisites

* **Docker** 20.10.0 or later (daemon must be running)
* **macOS** (Darwin) or **Linux**
* **amd64** or **arm64** architecture

### Resource recommendations

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CPU** | 4 cores | 8 cores |
| **RAM** | 8 GB | 16 GB |
| **Storage** | 50 GB | 500+ GB (varies by network) |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Running full Ethereum nodes requires significant disk space. Mainnet execution clients can require 1+ TB of storage.
