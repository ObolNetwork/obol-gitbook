## Welcome to Obol!

Obol’s core product is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), which empowers node operators, staking protocols, and institutions run Ethereum validators that are more secure, fault-tolerant, and performant. DVT benefits both operators and capital allocators while strengthening the network itself by reducing centralization risk and protecting against supermajority failures. Obol DVs are the staking endgame.

Whether you’re learning about DVT, integrating it into your staking stack, or want to stake your ETH on DVs, these docs will help you get started.
