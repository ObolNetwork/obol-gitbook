# Create a Lido stVault

{% hint style="info" %}
💡

Lido V3 introduces **stVaults** — customizable staking vaults that unlock stETH liquidity for institutional stakers and asset managers. **Obol Distributed Validators offer the most capital-efficient way to deploy an stVault**, unlocking the **highest minting capacity** and the end game staking configuration.

## Create a Lido stVault

**Target audience:** Node operators and capital allocators looking to deploy stVaults with **maximum capital efficiency** and institutional-grade security.

### Who This Kit Is For

**Node operators** who are:

* Being asked to **deploy, and operate** an stVault for a fund, DAO, protocol, or other allocator
* Building that vault on top of a **multi-operator Obol DV** rather than a single operator / single client setup

**Capital allocators** who:

* Need to understand **why** a DV-backed stVault can support more favorable risk assessments and reserve ratios
* Want a clear checklist for vetting operators and understanding what strong DV cluster operations look like

### Why Obol DVs Are the Best Way to Deploy an stVault

Lido V3's stVault design unlocks new levels of **capital efficiency** for node operators and institutional stakers. Obol Distributed Validators are **the most capital-efficient way to run a vault on Lido V3**.

One of Lido V3's key innovations is the **Reserve Ratio (RR)**, which determines how much ETH must be kept as a reserve buffer relative to minted stETH. Lido is proposing a **2% Reserve Ratio tier for verified multi-operator DV vaults**, allowing up to **98% stETH minting capacity**. This is the most favorable tier. By comparison, the next-highest default tier for identified operators proposes a 5% RR with only 95% minting capacity.

**Obol Distributed Validators unlock the highest minting capacity available on Lido V3.**

#### Key Benefits

* **Unlock the highest capital efficiency**\
  Multi-operator DV vaults qualify for the 2% Reserve Ratio tier, offering 98% stETH minting capacity, the most capital-efficient configuration on Lido V3.
* **Distribute responsibility across multiple operators**\
  Reduce reliance on any single infrastructure provider, company, or jurisdiction. Multi-operator setups distribute private key shares across many entities.
* **Maximize client and implementation diversity**\
  Run multiple consensus and execution client combinations inside the same vault, strengthening the vault's resilience and reducing correlation risks.
* **Superior liveness and fault tolerance**\
  Obol's fault-tolerant infrastructure means your validators keep performing even if individual operators experience downtime or failures.
* **Enterprise-grade security**\
  Leverage best-in-class security that institutional stakers and asset managers require for managing significant stake.

### 📚 How This Integration Kit Is Organized

### For Node Operators – Implementation Guide

A practical guide to designing, deploying, and operating an stVault using Obol DVs, including:

* What to collect from the vault owner
* How to design your DV cluster (operators, clients, geos)
* How to rehearse on testnet and prepare for mainnet launch
* How this integrates into the Lido V3 stVault flow

👉 **[Read the Node Operator Guide →](lido-v3-stvault-for-node-operator.md)**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### For Capital Allocators – Design & Risk Overview

A higher-level walkthrough of:

* What you are optimizing for (safety, yield, minting capacity, counterparty risk)
* Why multi-operator DVs are different from "just another node operator"
* How Obol's [**Cluster-as-a-Service**](https://hubs.ly/Q03Y2Srl0) offering can help guide your decisions
* What to ask from your operators or from Obol directly

#### Future Extensions

As Lido's [**DeFi wrapper**](https://hackmd.io/@lido/lido-v3-wrapper-design) and more advanced strategies roll out, we will extend this kit with:

* End-to-end reference architectures that combine stVaults, wrappers, and multi-operator DV clusters
* Config and deployment examples taken from real-world vaults
* Case studies, including the "Ethereum client team vault", once it is live

**For now, this page gives you the map. The linked sections show you how to actually build and run the vaults behind it.**
