# Push Metrics and Logs to Obol

{% hint style="info" %}
This is **optional but encouraged**, and does not confer any special privileges within Obol.
{% endhint %}

## Metrics
Metrics are statistics that are gathered on a periodic basis and used to visualise the health and performance of your Charon node and DV cluster. These metrics power your local Grafana dashboard, as well as the hosted dashboards. Submitting metrics to the Obol Core team will allow you to see advanced performance analytics on Obol's hosted platform, as well as to opt into automated alerting whenever something goes wrong with your node.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="(L)CDVN Quickstart" %}
This is for operators using the [example repo](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-node) from our [quickstart guide](./quickstart_overview.md) (or [Lido equivalent](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-node)), and have been provided with **Monitoring Credentials** used to push Distributed Validator metrics to Obol's central Prometheus cluster to monitor, analyze, and improve their Distributed Validator Cluster's performance. (For example, this is necessary to participate in the Obol [Techne](https://squadstaking.com/techne) credential program.)

#### Update the monitoring token in the `.env` file

* Inside your `.env` file, uncomment the `PROM_REMOTE_WRITE_TOKEN` line by removing the `#` symbol.
* Enter your monitoring token in the format shown below:

```shell
PROM_REMOTE_WRITE_TOKEN=your_monitoring_token
```

#### Save the `.env` file and restart Prometheus

Save the `.env` file, and run the `docker compose up -d` command, and prometheus will be restarted to apply the changes.

```shell
docker compose up -d
# Alternatively
docker compose restart prometheus
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dappnode" %}
The last step in your DappNode setup is to add your Monitoring Credentials. This allows you to push distributed validator metrics to Obol’s central Prometheus cluster for monitoring, analysis, and performance optimization of your Distributed Validator Cluster. It also facilitates easier troubleshooting with the Obol team when needed.

1.  Get Prometheus credentials from Obol, which will look like:

    ```
    obol20tnt8UC...
    ```
2.  Navigate to your Obol package in DappNode and go to the Config tab.

3. At the bottom of the page, add the credential token under **Prometheus Monitoring Credentials (optional)**, then click the **Update** button.
4.  Return to the **Info** tab, scroll down to the Containers section, and click the down arrow to view all container statuses. If the Prometheus container is stopped, please restart it.

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="DV-Pod" %}

Get a Prometheus monitoring credential from the Obol core team, it will look like:

```log
obol20tnt8UC...
```

Then, either add `--set centralMonitoring.enabled=true --set-string centralMonitoring.token='YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'` to your `helm install` command, or if using a Values.yaml file, update `centralMonitoring.enabled` to `true`, and `centralMonitoring.token` to the monitoring credential you have been given, and then install/upgrade the chart.

```yaml
# -- Central Monitoring
centralMonitoring:
  # -- Specifies whether central monitoring should be enabled
  enabled: true
  # -- https endpoint to obol central prometheus
  promEndpoint: "https://vm.monitoring.gcp.obol.tech/write"
  # -- The authentication token to the central Obol prometheus instance
  token: "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Logs

Metrics show the performance of a cluster, but sometimes, there is reason to go into deeper detail of a clusters runtime, by reviewing its logs. Sometimes logs from the Charon client alone are sufficient, but often times (for example in the case of a missed proposal), the logs from other parts of the stack are necessary to debug a situation (e.g. a MEV-sidecar and a beacon node). 

An Obol core team member will give you a URL to send your logs to, and if feasible, sending all logs is preferable to sending only Charon logs. In custom deployments that might not be convenient or feasible, and sending only Charon logs may suffice. Follow the instructions below to configure automated log submission.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="All Logs" %}
If you are using one of our [Quickstart](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-node) [repos](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/lido-charon-distributed-validator-node), you should uncomment the `CHARON_LOKI_ADDRESSES` environment variable, and save the URL provided to you by the Obol team as the value, you should also uncomment `MONITORING=${MONITORING:-monitoring},monitoring-log-collector` to enable the [Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/) container, which collects logs from all containers and submits them to Obol. Once you've saved these changes to your `.env` file, you should run `docker compose up -d` to (re)start the containers as needed.

```env
# Uncomment and set the log URL
CHARON_LOKI_ADDRESSES="URL here"

# Uncomment both and set to the details of your node, otherwise the core team won't be able to isolate your logs amongst all the others
CLUSTER_NAME="The name of your cluster"
CLUSTER_PEER="The name of your peer. e.g. approachable-chair, unsightly-couch"

# Uncomment
MONITORING=${MONITORING:-monitoring},monitoring-log-collector
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Charon Logs Only" %}
Given a URL, you can either pass it to Charon as an additional flag to `charon run`, or by setting an environment variable on the Charon container.
```sh
--loki-addresses="URL here"
```
Or:
```env
CHARON_LOKI_ADDRESSES="URL here"
```
{% endtab %}
