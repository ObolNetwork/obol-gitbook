# Grant Track for Establishing OBOL Token’s Role in DeFi & Governance

The following guide will provide you with all the info you need to apply for a grant related to Establishing OBOL Token’s Role in DeFi & Governance. [You can apply directly on Questbook, here](https://questbook.app/proposal_form/?grantId=6808df2e9ccae779614de4a6\&chainId=10\&utm_source=questbook\&utm_medium=grant_details\&utm_campaign=share).

## Is My Grant Request In-Scope for This Grant Track?

This Grant Track focuses on helping OBOL become a **core asset in Ethereum DeFi and protocol governance**, with emphasis on **TGE unlock success**, **on/off-chain liquidity**, and **DeFi integrations**.

Your proposal is **in-scope** if it contributes to any of the following:

* Improving liquidity of OBOL/stOBOL on DEXs and aggregators
* Deploying stOBOL as collateral or governance asset in DeFi protocols
* Developing tools, bridges, dashboards, or data integrations for OBOL
* Enhancing token UX or reputation (e.g. Chainlink oracles, analytics)

> While the TGE and unlock strategy is centrally executed by the Obol Association, the community is encouraged to support OBOL's DeFi path via proposals, integrations, and partnerships.

## Grant Track Priorities & Goals

#### **Category A – Deep Liquidity & Market Presence**

* Details: Provide ample liquidity so that participants can easily trade in and out of (st)OBOL. This ensures market confidence in the token being able to trade large volumes and sustain swings in price actions without too many negative effects such as slippage.
* Metrics:
  * Deploy stOBOL as collateral on one Top 10 TVL DeFi Protocols (e.g. Morpho)
* Exemples:
  * Design & deploy a stOBOL liquidity vault on Arrakis, Balancer, or Maverick
  * Propose DAO-level liquidity incentives across DeFi venues
    * Gauge votes, flywheels, or incentive co-funding with protocols.
  * Deploy stOBOL as collateral in a major DeFi protocol
    * Morpho, Aave, Compound, or FraxLend. Proposal should outline required steps (audits, onboarding, etc).
  * Build integrations, bridges, or tools for token usability
    * Token routers, zap tools, multi-chain bridges, UI UX support for using OBOL/stOBOL.

## Milestone Articulation

Grants will be disbursed based on **milestone-based funding**, with a focus on **liquidity outcomes**, **integration readiness**, and **community activation**.

Typical milestones may include:

* Smart contract deployment (vault, adapter, collateral wrapper)
* Governance proposal submission and/or approval
* Integration live on testnet/mainnet
* Trading volume or liquidity KPIs achieved (e.g. $1M TVL, $500K 30D volume)
* Community feedback incorporated or UI launched

> Aim to tie final milestones to live integrations or measurable liquidity metrics.

## Security Requirements

* Smart contract deployments must be audited or forked from audited sources
* Where necessary, coordinate audits with the Obol Association
* Audit completion must be a milestone for DeFi protocol integrations

## What Makes a Strong Proposal?

* **Strategic Fit**: Aligns directly with OBOL’s token vision (see OIP-1 & OIP-2)
* **Credible Team**: Strong DeFi, token, or liquidity experience
* **Tangible Outcomes**: Focus on integrations, liquidity depth, or real utility
* **Governance Aware**: Engages with DAO or DeFi governance in a thoughtful way
* **Long-Term View**: Includes sustainability considerations (e.g. vault maintenance, fee-sharing)
