# Grant Track for  Optimizing Decentralized Governance

## Is My Grant Request In-Scope for This Grant Track?

This Grant Track welcomes proposals that:

* Incentivize sustained delegate participation in governance
* Develop transparent staking-linked reward systems for delegates and token holders
* Create tooling or frameworks to surface and reward governance activity
* Formalize the implementation of Obol’s grants infrastructure
* Support the execution of SQUAD-aligned grant initiatives

Proposals are **in-scope** if they strengthen the Obol Collective’s governance through **better tools**, **stronger incentives**, or **more coordinated participation**.

## Grant Track Priorities & **Goal**s

This Grant Track hosts the following **Grant** **Requests** that align with the governance roadmap:

#### **Category A – Sustained Delegate Participation**

*   **Goal A1**: Build an **Active Delegate Dashboard** or “Karma Score” system

    _Goal_: Reward token holders delegating to consistently engaged, high-quality delegates

    _Scope_: Track votes, proposal participation, on-chain/off-chain commentary
*   **Goal A2**: Design a **staking reward incentive layer** for active delegates

    _Goal_: Allow delegates to earn a portion of OBOL staking rewards for governance activity

    _Scope_: On-chain logic + UI + tracking
*   **Goal A3**: Create a **governance reputation system**

    _Goal_: Assign transparent scoring or reputation based on delegate behavior

    _Inspiration_: Karma, Otterspace, SourceCred, Coordinape

#### **Category B – Formalizing the Grants Program**

*   **Goal B1**: Implement a milestone-based Grants Program for the Obol Association

    _Goal_: Launch and manage the system that will award and track 5+ grants tied to SQUAD goals

    _Scope_: On-chain or hybrid tracking, payout workflows, reporting dashboards
*   **Goal B2**: Build grant selection & feedback tooling for the Obol Collective

    _Goal_: Let community members review, endorse, or comment on grant proposals

    _Scope_: Lightweight DAO-native frontend, Quadratic voting/endorsements optional

## Milestone Articulation

Proposals should include **3–5 milestones**, structured around **outcomes** and **governance impact**. Strong proposals may include milestones like:

* Design specs or mockups published and shared with delegates
* MVP shipped to testnet or DAO-wide demo
* Governance module deployed or integrated
* Delegate onboarding supported with documentation or workshops
* Community endorsement or adoption (on-chain or off-chain)

> 🛠 Projects involving on-chain rewards, delegate dashboards, or governance contracts should include a milestone for audit or external review, prior to mainnet deployment.

## What Makes a Strong Proposal?

* **Problem Alignment**: Addresses a real governance challenge — delegate drop-off, unclear rewards, limited visibility
* **Clear Implementation Plan**: The path to delivery is scoped, timed, and explained
* **Community Fit**: Respects and supports the Obol Collective’s values of openness and resilience
* **Participation-First**: Empowers active contributors, rather than reinforcing centralization
* **Future-Proof**: Designed for long-term utility and open-source reuse
