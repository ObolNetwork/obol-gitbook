# Grant Track for Boosting Obol DV Adoption

The following guide will provide you with all the info you need to apply for a grant related to **Boosting Obol DV Adoption**. [You can apply directly on Questbook, here.](https://questbook.app/proposal_form/?grantId=6808de63300aee1f224f930a\&chainId=10\&utm_source=questbook\&utm_medium=grant_details\&utm_campaign=share)

## Is My Proposal In-Scope for This Grant Track?

This Grant Track seeks **technical integrations**, **infrastructure tooling**, and **adoption-driven initiatives** that accelerate the adoption of Obol DVs â€” especially in high-stake sectors like Liquid Staking, Restaking, and Community Squads.

Proposals are **in-scope** if they:

* Integrate Obol DVs into staking protocols (e.g. Lido v3, Etherfi, Swell, EigenLayer)
* Launch or grow community squads staking with DVs
* Build tools, dashboards, or deployment frameworks that reduce barriers to DV adoption
* Educate or onboard new users and node operators into the Obol ecosystem

## Grant Track Priorities & Squad Goals

This Grant Track hosts the following **Squad Goals** that represent Obol community priorities:

#### **Category A â€“ Deepen DVs penetration into (Re-)Staking Protocols**

* Details: Integrate Obol DVs as the infrastructure layer of Liquid Staking & Restaking Protocols. Protocols represent about 37.5% of the Ethereum stake according to [Hildobbyâ€™s staking data](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking). Obol DVs currently [represent about 2%](https://obol.org/dashboard) of that stake. Example workstream: Collaborations with top protocols existing and new products (e.g., Lido v3, Etherfi eETH, Swell rswETH).
* Success Metrics: Make Obol DVs 10% of the Protocols Stake share.
* Exemples:&#x20;
  * Integrate Obol DVs into a Liquid Staking or Restaking protocol
  * Build SDKs, APIs, or plugins that simplify DV integrations for protocols.
    * Deployment scripts, wrapper contracts, REST APIs, infra automation tools

#### **Category B â€“ Deepen DVs penetration with community squads**

* Details: Launch more community squads across the globe. Continue building launcher tooling and educational content on DVs to make squad staking easy. Currently Obol community squads run about 15,000 ETH. Example workstream: Programs to assist new node operators in setting up and fund Obol DVs.
* Success Metrics:
  1. 20 new community squads
  2. 25,000 ETH running on Obol DVs.
* Exemples:&#x20;
  * Create launcher tooling or deployment guides to enable squads.&#x20;
  * Run educational campaigns, community events, or node operator bootcamps
  * Build dashboards, docs, or user-facing UX that reduces DV friction.

## Milestone Articulation

Grants in this track will be disbursed based on **clear, outcome-oriented milestones**, ideally aligned with measurable KPIs.

Competitive grant requests include **3â€“5 milestones**, such as:

* Signed protocol integration commitment
* Live testnet deployment
* Mainnet launch with DV cluster
* Target stake threshold hit (e.g., 1,000 ETH in DVs)
* Community feedback, docs, or case studies

> ðŸ’¡ Milestones should include both technical outcomes and adoption-based KPIs.&#x20;

## Security & Audit Requirements

Proposals involving smart contract deployments must:

* Document contracts clearly in the proposal
* If relevant, undergo audit from a reputable third-party auditor (e.g., Dedaub, ChainSecurity)
* Include audit as a funded milestone
* Complete audit before any mainnet funds are disbursed

***

## What Makes a Strong Grant Request?

* **Clear Impact**: Shows a measurable path to DV adoption across a protocol, institution, or community
* **Strong Team**: Has relevant experience in staking, infra, or validator tech
* **Ecosystem Fit**: Aligns with Obol's decentralization and resilience mission
* **Detailed Milestones**: Tied to real-world outcomes, not just deliverable completion
* **Sustainable Plan**: Long-term support considered (infra, community, updates)
