# How to create a proposal in Questbook?

This guide walks you through the full process of preparing and submitting a grant proposal to the Obol Grants Program using [Questbook](https://questbook.app).

### 1. Respect the Wave Schedule

Each grant wave follows a strict timeline. Grant requests must be submitted during the **application window** listed in the [Grants Program page](./).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Proposals submitted outside of an open wave window will **not** be considered.

***

### 2. Choose the Right Grant Track

Your grant request must clearly align with **one of the four main grant tracks**, which are tied to the Obol Collective's SQUAD goals. Each track has its own page with:

* Scope verification checklist
* Expectations and contribution types
* Evaluation criteria used during review

_**On each grant track page, you will find the link to apply for that specific track on Questbook.**_&#x20;

üëâ Visit the grant track guides linked [here](./#structure).

***

### 3. Prepare to Submit on Questbook

#### If you don't already have a Questbook account:

* Go to [https://questbook.app](https://questbook.app)
* Create a new wallet or connect an existing one
* Back up your wallet's private key securely ‚Äî you will need it to access your account

***

### 4. Create Your Application

1. Select the grant **track** aligned with your grant request and follow the link provided in the dedicated subpage
2. Complete each section of the form, including:
   * Project summary
   * Team & track record
   * Grant track alignment
   * Milestones & timelines
   * Requested funding & deliverables per milestone

Each section is pre-structured to guide you in providing the expected information.&#x20;

***

### 5. Include Your Cost Breakdown

You must attach a cost breakdown using the **template provided by the Obol Association** (linked below).

* You may modify the structure, add/remove rows, or use your own format if clearly structured.
* Make sure costs are tied to **milestones**, not just a lump sum.

***

### 6. Post in the Forum

Once your application is submitted on Questbook:

* Go to the **Obol Grants Forum Thread** link here
* Post a comment with:
  * Your project name
  * A short summary
  * A link to your Questbook grant request

This ensures community visibility and transparency.

***

### 7. What Happens Next

* During the review period (after the wave closes), your grant request will be evaluated by the current committee.
* Reviews will use the rubric published in your track‚Äôs page to evaluate your request.
* Feedback may be shared on Questbook or through the forum.

**If approved:**

* You‚Äôll be contacted for milestone validation and next steps for funding.
* Disbursements will occur **after milestone delivery is validated.**
