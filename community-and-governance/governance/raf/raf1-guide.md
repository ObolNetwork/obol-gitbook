# RAF #1

## Learnings from RAF Round 1

Our first Retroactive Funding round (RAF1) awarded 1 million OBOL to 46 projects using a quadratic voting mechanism. Projects were evaluated on technical impact, contribution to decentralization, and public goods alignment.

### Top-funded projects included:

* Dappnode â€” integrated Obol into their Dappstore, enabling 16k+ validators to use Obol setups.
* Ethereum on ARM â€” ran distributed validators on low-cost devices.
* Stereum â€” offered one-click node deployment with Obol pre-installed, backed by strong GitHub and beaconcha.in adoption metrics.

### Key learnings:

* Impact evaluation is challenging without clear data; future rounds may require stronger entry thresholds.
* Quadratic voting worked to elevate broadly supported projects, but needed clearer onboarding.
* Delegates requested better UX for wallets and real-time visibility into vote progress.
* Community engagement was strong but limited in feedback volume â€” improving outreach will be a focus

_**Weâ€™re using these insights to shape future RAF rounds, with an emphasis on transparency, fairness, and long-term ecosystem impact.**_
