# Grants Program

We are excited to launch the **Obol Grants Program**. After a successful pilot wave that supported several meaningful initiatives, we‚Äôre doubling down on our commitment to ecosystem growth.

If you're curious about what we funded in the past, check out our [Grants Pilot Wrap-Up blog post](https://blog.obol.org/grants-program-pilot-wave-report-pilot-phase-wrap-up/). It includes full context and direct links to our Questbook portal where you can browse the funded projects and on-chain disbursement records.

## Purpose

The Obol Grants Program supports projects that advance the strategic goals of the Obol. The goal is to:

* Provide milestone-based funding to **builders** aligned with our goals
* Offer a standardized and permissionless framework for **educators and event organizers** to run impactful Obol-focused community events & workshops
* Enable technical contributors to pick up **open-source missions** from our backlog

This program exists to extend the reach of the Collective: helping us ship faster, strengthen adoption of Distributed Validators (DVs), other important Obol technology, and empower contributors globally.

## Structure

The Grants Program is organized into **three distinct Grant Tracks:**

### [Staking Mastery Program](grants-track-for-staking-masters.md)

* For contributors applying to work on any of the [Obol Collective 2025 SQUAD Goals](https://community.obol.org/t/oip-3-obol-collective-2025-goals-proposal/388)&#x20;
* This track revives the original Staking Mastery Program. I will now be running on a rolling basis to support research and technical contributions that advance distributed staking
* Open application process with milestone-based disbursement

### [Community Events & Workshops](grants-track-for-community-events.md)

* For anyone hosting Obol-focused workshops, meetups or onboarding sessions
* Permissionless structure, funded retroactively based on proof of attendance and impact

### [Open Strategic Missions](grants-track-for-open-strategic-missions/strategic-open-missions.md)

* Pre-scoped, technical tasks created by Obol
* Contributors can apply to complete these missions for funding
