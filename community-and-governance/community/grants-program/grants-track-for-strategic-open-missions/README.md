## Overview, Eligibility and Scope

This track enables technical contributors to pick up **pre-scoped missions** designed by the Obol team.

These missions are ideal for developers looking to ship meaningful tooling, research, or infrastructure improvements for **Obol Distributed Validators.**

These missions are published directly in the [section below](https://docs.obol.org/~/revisions/XY6k3JVM6FfyM21je9Hy/community-and-governance/community/grants-program/grants-track-for-strategic-open-missions/strategic-open-missions). Each mission outlines:

* The scope of work
* The deliverables expected
* The funding offered
* Context and materials

This track is open to:

* Independent developers and small technical teams
* Individuals with proven experience in Ethereum staking, especially Distributed Validators

Our goal is to reduce internal backlog by collaborating with technically proficient external contributors who want to build meaningful tooling, integrations, or research for the Obol ecosystem.

## Budget & Funding

Each mission comes with a proposed **budget offer.** These grants follow a **milestone-based payment** model:

* Milestones are defined up front as part of the mission spec or during onboarding
* Funding is disbursed **only after milestone completion is validated**

If adjustments are needed to the scope or funding, these will be clarified before the contributor starts work.

## Submission Process

Anyone interested in picking up a mission must fill out a [short application form](https://forms.gle/SgUx4n7hAZ28JpY47). It will request:

* Name of the mission
* Background and relevant experience of the applicant(s)
* Relevant GitHub links or previous work
* Optional: Questions or additional clarification requests

Only after submitting this form and receiving explicit approval may a contributor begin work.

## Evaluation & Review

Once an application form is submitted, Obol will provide a first response within **seven open business days**, which will be one of the following:

1. ‚úÖ **Accepted**: The contributor is cleared to begin work
2. ‚ùå **Rejected**: The contributor is not a fit or the mission is already taken
3. üí¨ **Further discussion required**: Additional alignment on scope, timeline, or budget is needed

If you begin work without approval, we reserve the right to decline funding even if the work is completed.

## Expectations & Visibility

Contributors to this grant track will be expected to:

* Provide milestone updates or completion summaries
* Be open to publishing public recaps or demos

In return, Obol will:

* Highlight completed missions on social channels
