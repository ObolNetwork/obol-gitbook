## Open Strategic Missions

This section lists specific, high-impact technical initiatives Obol has decided to open to external contributors. These are projects that contribute meaningfully to the Obol Distributed Validators (DVs) and we welcome applications from individuals or teams with the right expertise.

Each mission includes a pre-defined scope and fixed budget. All applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

{% hint style="danger" %}
All Open Missions must go through the official application and evaluation process before work begins. Milestone-based funding is tracked via Questbook and paid upon approval.

**Goal**: Prototype and benchmark how Trusted Execution Environments (Intel TDX) can secure DV operations.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Run a DVT node (Charon + VC) inside Intel TDX
* Benchmark performance and risk mitigation
* Produce documentation, open-source code, and in-depth report

**Funding**: $10,000 in stables + $10,000 in $OBOL

**Status**: Started (September 2025)

### Ansible Playbooks for Obol DVT (Jeremiah Sullivan)

**Goal**: Build automated Ansible roles for DVT cluster deployment and home staking setups.
