## Overview, Eligibility and Scope

The **Staking Mastery Program** is a rolling grant track designed to empower individual contributors and small technical teams working to advance distributed staking. This track revives the ethos of the original [Staking Mastery Cohorts](../staking-masters.md) by preserving their spirit of excellence, but adapts the structure to support proactive applications aligned with the [Obol Collective‚Äôs 2025 SQUAD Goals](https://community.obol.org/t/oip-3-obol-collective-2025-goals-proposal/388).

Unlike the original cohort-based model, this new iteration operates on a rolling basis. Contributors can apply at any time to work on initiatives that push forward distributed validator adoption, improve technical general infrastructure, or deliver impactful research. The focus here is technical. One time education initiatives are supported separately through our [Community Events track](grants-track-for-community-events.md).

This grant track is designed for proactive applications submitted by individual contributors or small teams interested in helping the Collective move forward. These can include topics such as:

* Deepening DV penetration in staking and restaking protocols
* Expanding DV accessibility through tooling or automation
* Improving infrastructure compatibility with Obol DVs
* Conducting meaningful research in distributed validator technologies
* Integrating Defi protocols or adding more utility to the token



**To be eligible, applications must:**

* Be aligned with the 2025 SQUAD Goals of the Obol Collective
* Propose realistic deliverables that advance distributed staking
* Be led by individuals or small teams with proven technical expertise in staking, governance, infrastructure, or Ethereum protocols

There is no fixed format or size constraint for proposals. We welcome both small- and large-scope projects  but they should be concrete, measurable, and narratively clear.

## Budget & Funding

Applicants must request funding using the template included in the application form. All budgets should be **denominated in USD** for clarity, and payments will be made in **OBOL token equivalents** at the time of disbursement.

Grants are **milestone-based**. This means:

* Funding is **not disbursed upfront**.
* Each milestone must be **completed and approved** before the associated funding is released.
* Once a milestone is validated, the grantee can move on to the next phase and receive subsequent funding.

## Submission Process

There is no deadline or wave. Applications are accepted on a **rolling basis**.

To apply, simply [fill out the dedicated application form](https://forms.gle/hJfXtGZFZqNoWAyE8), which includes sections for:

* An overview of your project and its alignment with the Collective‚Äôs SQUAD Goals
* A breakdown of proposed milestones and deliverables
* Team background and relevant experience
* A detailed cost breakdown and requested budget (USD-denominated)

## Evaluation & Review

Once a submission is received, applicants can expect an **initial triage within 7 business days**. This first response will fall into one of three categories:

1. ‚úÖ **Accepted** ‚Äî you‚Äôre good to move forward as-is.
2. ‚ùå **Rejected** ‚Äî the proposal is not aligned or not feasible at this time.
3. üí¨ **Discussion Required** ‚Äî we‚Äôre interested, but need further alignment on scope, milestones, or budget.

In most cases, we anticipate some **back-and-forth discussion** to refine the proposal before final approval.

Once aligned, applicants will be asked to **submit the final version** of the grant to Questbook, including:

* Project overview
* Final milestones
* Approved budget

Questbook will serve as the **source of truth** for the proposal and allow anyone to **track the funding on-chain.**

## Expectations & Visibility

We want to showcase the valuable work being built across the ecosystem.

Upon completion of significant milestones (or the full project), we‚Äôll highlight the grant publicly via:

* Obol‚Äôs social channels
* Periodic blog posts or newsletters summarizing recent grants

We also encourage grantees to share their own updates publicly, to **build visibility** for both their work and the broader Collective.
