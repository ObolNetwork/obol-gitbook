# Grants Track for Community Events

This track supports permissionless, retroactive funding for Obol-focused local events, workshops, and onboarding sessions focused on Distributed Validators.

The goal is to empower community leaders to grow Obol on the ground, with a clear and standardized support model.

You can explore all supported events on [Questbook](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=68d793dd306fa3a0a64b83c2\&chainId=10).

***

## Overview, Eligibility and Scope

This track is designed to support **community-led educational events and workshops** that are **entirely focused on Obol Distributed Validators (DVs)**. These events should serve to onboard new participants, educate existing ones, and help expand the reach of Obol on the ground.

To ensure consistency and predictability, this track uses a **permissionless framework** for supporting events with **up to 100 attendees.** Larger events may still be supported, but require prior coordination.

Funding is available for two types of outcomes:

1. **The event itself** ‚Äî covering costs related to the event venue, food and beverages.
2. S**uccessful conversions to Obol DVs** ‚Äî when attendees go on to spin up Distributed Validators using Obol technology, the event host or operators may qualify for a bonus reward.

All events must:

* Be **fully centered on Obol DVs**
* Be **submitted with the required proofs** to unlock retroactive funding upon verification
* Be limited to **100 participants or fewer** for automatic eligibility

## Budget & Funding

### üçï 1. Food & Drink Budget (Event Support)

To help cover the costs of hosting, we provide **up to $15 per verified attendee**, retroactively, upon proof of the event. This amount includes the event venue, food, drinks, and minor operational expenses.

* This support is **capped at 100 attendees per event.**
* Verification requirements are listed in the next section (‚ÄúSubmission Process‚Äù).

### üß™ 2. TVS Conversion Bonus (Net New Stake Incentive)

To reward tangible ecosystem growth, we offer a **0.1% bonus of the total net new TVS (Total Value Staked)** attributable to your event.

* Only **Obol-based DV clusters** are eligible.
* The **conversion must clearly follow from the event**, with proof submitted and verified.
* Bonus payouts will be made **monthly** over a **12-month period**, so long as the validators remain active.

{% hint style="success" %}
For example, if your event led to the launch of 5 validators totaling 160 ETH (‚âà$640K TVS with ETH at $4000), you could be eligible for a $640 bonus, distributed over 12 months (\~$53.33/month), assuming validators remain online and performing.
{% endhint %}

This structure is designed to:

* Ensure **sustainable staking growth**, not just one-time deposits
* Protect against potential **farming or gaming** of the bonus system
* Reward contributors for **long-term value creation** in the network

{% hint style="danger" %}
All budgets will be denominated in USD for clarity, and payments will be made in OBOL token equivalents at the time of disbursement.
{% endhint %}

{% endhint %}

_The TVS conversion bonus will be paid directly to the operator who submits the form and verifies their validator address. It is then up to them to decide if or how they wish to share this bonus with the event organizer or other contributors. The Obol Association reserves the right to modify the bonus structure or reward calculation method at any time for future submissions. Any bonuses already approved and in-progress will remain unchanged and honored as agreed._

## Submission Process

The Community Events track uses a simple **three-step submission flow**. Only one of them is optional, the rest are required for funding.

### 1. [Pre-Event Form (optional but recommended)](https://forms.gle/Y5LTpEkF3TThRNUo9)

We encourage hosts to fill out a short form **ahead of their event** to let the Association know what‚Äôs being planned. While not mandatory, this step allows us to:

* Coordinate on visibility and cross-post the event on official channels
* Offer lightweight guidance or connections if needed
* Ensure the event fits within the scope of this grant track

### 2. [Post-Event Submission (required for pizza & food budget)](https://forms.gle/MRZEaX3DtSZe9jSK7)

After the event, hosts must fill out a **proof-of-event** form to unlock retroactive funding. This submission must include:

* A **public tweet thread** summarizing the event\
  ‚Ü≥ Must highlight Obol DVs and mention @ObolCollective
* A **group photo** from the event, with clear timestamp and the organizer present
* Any **slides or presentation materials** used during the event
* A link to the **Luma page (or equivalent)** used for RSVPs\
  ‚Ü≥ Must include attendee list
* **Receipts** (food/beverage/venue) matching the number of participants

_**Once submitted, your application will be reviewed and ‚Äî if approved ‚Äî disburse the food & drink budget (up to $15/attendee, max 100 attendees).**_

### 3. [TVS Conversion Bonus Submission (required for validator conversion bonus)](https://forms.gle/cmz5uw6cCwM5pZi96)

There‚Äôs no deadline here, submit any time after the event once validators are live. To unlock your **TVS Conversion Bonus**, we require to fill the dedicated form with:

* A submission from one of the **validator operators**, including:
  * **Ethereum address** used to run the validator (to prove ownership)
  * **Details of the Distributed Validator cluster** (to verify it was launched post-event)
  * **Statement of correlation** explaining how the event led to this onboarding
* Follow-up confirmation from the **event organizer**
* A **public recap** from the host listing the validators or clusters onboarded via the event

_**Once submitted, your application will be reviewed and ‚Äî if approved ‚Äî we will distribute the TVS bonus (0.1% of net new TVS distributed over 12 months).**_

## Evaluation & Review

For **each of the three forms submitted** (pre-event intent, post-event proof, or TVS conversion bonus), Obol will respond within **seven open business days** with one of the following:

* ‚úÖ **Accepted**
* ‚ùå **Rejected**
* üí¨ **Needs additional information**

Once post-event materials have been reviewed and accepted, the host will be asked to **submit the final version of the application to Questbook**, including:

* A summary of the event
* Final verified participant count
* Funding amount (e.g. food & drink budget)

This Questbook submission will serve as the **source of truth for transparency and on-chain funding**.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
If a validator conversion bonus is approved at a later date, it will be logged as a second milestone under the same Questbook grant and funded accordingly.
{% endhint %}

## Expectations & Visibility

We want to **showcase and amplify** meaningful contributions from the community.

* If the event was flagged in advance via the optional pre-event form, we may help promote it via **Obol's official social media channels**, including social media and/or Discord.
* Once an event has been successfully validated and funded, it will be included in **periodic blog posts or funding recap threads.**
* We strongly encourage hosts to post their own event recaps publicly on X (Twitter) and **tag @ObolCollective** to boost visibility of their work and highlight the role of DVs in the broader staking ecosystem.
