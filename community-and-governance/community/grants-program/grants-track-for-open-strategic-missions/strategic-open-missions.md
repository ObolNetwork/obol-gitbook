## Open Strategic Missions <a href="#open-strategic-missions" id="open-strategic-missions"></a>

This section lists specific, high-impact technical initiatives Obol has decided to open to external contributors. These are projects that contribute meaningfully to the Obol Distributed Validators (DVs) and we welcome applications from individuals or teams with the right expertise.

Each mission includes a pre-defined scope and fixed budget. All applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

{% hint style="danger" %}
All Open Missions must go through the official application and evaluation process before work begins. Milestone-based funding is tracked via Questbook and paid upon approval.
