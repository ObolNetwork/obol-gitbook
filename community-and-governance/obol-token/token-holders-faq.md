# Token Holders FAQ

## General

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the OBOL token used for?</strong></summary>

OBOL is the governance token of the Obol Collective. It enables holders to participate in on-chain governance by voting directly or delegating their voting power to delegates.

OBOL is also used in the [RAF](../governance/raf/), where token holders delegate to vote on which contributors should receive retroactive funding for valuable work.

In addition, OBOL can be staked to receive stOBOL, a liquid token that accrues staking rewards and retains governance power as long as it remains in the staker’s wallet. This staking mechanism supports long-term alignment and decentralized ownership.

Finally, both OBOL and stOBOL are being integrated into DeFi protocols, such as liquidity pools, lending platforms (e.g. Morpho), and restaking services (e.g. Eigenlayer, Symbiotic), with more utility expected over time as shaped by community governance.

## Token Value & Utility
