# Token Holders FAQ

## General

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the OBOL token used for?</strong></summary>

OBOL is the governance token of the Obol Collective. It enables holders to participate in on-chain governance by voting directly or delegating their voting power to delegates.&#x20;

OBOL is also used in the [RAF](../governance/raf/), where token holders delegate to vote on which contributors should receive retroactive funding for valuable work.

In addition, OBOL can be staked to receive stOBOL, a liquid token that accrues staking rewards and retains governance power as long as it remains in the staker’s wallet. This staking mechanism supports long-term alignment and decentralized ownership.

Finally, both OBOL and stOBOL are being integrated into DeFi protocols, such as liquidity pools, lending platforms (e.g. Morpho), and restaking services (e.g. Eigenlayer, Symbiotic), with more utility expected over time as shaped by community governance.

<details>

<summary><strong>What is stOBOL?</strong></summary>

stOBOL is the liquid staking token received when you stake OBOL. It earns staking rewards and can be used in DeFi. Holding stOBOL in your wallet preserves your governance power. More info in [staking-and-stobol.md](staking-and-stobol.md "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Where can I see OBOL price, supply, and markets?</strong></summary>

You can track OBOL on [CoinMarketCap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/obol-2) or [Coingecko](https://coingecko.com). These pages include market data, supply information, and live price charts.

</details>

## Delegation & Governance

<details>

<summary><strong>How do I delegate my OBOL tokens?</strong></summary>

You can delegate via [vote.obol.org](https://vote.obol.org/dao/delegates). Connect your wallet, choose a delegate, and confirm the delegation transaction.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What happens if I stake OBOL?</strong></summary>

You receive stOBOL, which maintains your delegation as long as it stays in your wallet. Once transferred (e.g., to a DeFi protocol), you lose the individual delegation. Voting power is then routed via an [auto-delegation strategy](staking-and-stobol.md#how-the-overwhelming-support-strategy-works).&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I change my delegate?</strong></summary>

Yes, you can re-delegate at any time through the Collective Portal at [vote.obol.org](https://vote.obol.org)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Does holding OBOL give me passive income?</strong></summary>

Not directly. Only staking OBOL (to receive auto-compounding stOBOL) allows you to earn rewards.

</details>

## Staking & stOBOL

<details>

<summary><strong>How do I stake OBOL?</strong></summary>

Use [stake.obol.org](https://stake.obol.org) to stake. You’ll receive auto-compounding stOBOL in return.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I transfer stOBOL?</strong></summary>

Yes, stOBOL is a fully transferable ERC-20 token. However, if you transfer it, your direct delegation is lost, and your governance power enters the auto-delegation pool.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Where can I use stOBOL?</strong></summary>

stOBOL can be used in DeFi protocols (e.g., as collateral, in LPs, etc.). Integrations are ongoing and will be announced via Discord and Twitter.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I unstake OBOL?</strong></summary>

Yes. You can return stOBOL to the staking contract at anytime without lockup to reclaim your OBOL. Unstaking and restaking interfaces are provided at [stake.obol.org](https://stake.obol.org).

</details>

## Token Value & Utility

<details>

<summary><strong>What gives the OBOL token value?</strong></summary>

OBOL gains utility through governance rights, staking yield, and its use in DeFi. Long term, its value could be tied to the growth of the Obol Network, including fees, protocol usage, and TVL.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Does OBOL accrue fees?</strong></summary>

Currently, OBOL does not accrue protocol revenue. However, the DAO may vote in the future to direct protocol revenue toward token holders or stakers.
