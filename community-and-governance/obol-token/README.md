<summary>Auto Delegate (Overwhelming Support Strategy)</summary>

This mechanism uses tokens that would otherwise not be available in governance to ensure uncontroversial proposals will meet quorum.

  * Proposals voted on by the strategy
  * Vote power amounts cast
  * Event logs showing execution activity

<summary>Lockup / Unlock Contract (Airdrop Claim NFTs</summary>

* **Contract name:** ObolLockups
* **Address:** [0x3b9122704a20946e9cb49b2a8616ccc0f0d61adb](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3b9122704a20946e9cb49b2a8616ccc0f0d61adb)
* **Network:** Ethereum mainnet
* **Purpose:** This contract was used during the OBOL airdrop to manage token lockups. Airdrop allocations were issued as **NFT-based lockups**, allowing recipients to claim their tokens and unlock them over time **without a fixed deadline**. The original claiming interface ([claim.obol.org](http://claim.obol.org)) is no longer live. However, the lockups remain fully accessible **onchain**, and users can still unlock their tokens directly via the contract.
* **How the mechanism works:**
  * Each airdrop recipient received an NFT representing a locked OBOL allocation.
  * The NFT encodes the lockup parameters.
  * Tokens can be unlocked by calling the unlock function on the contract once the conditions are met.
* **What you can find onchain:**
  * NFT ownership (ownerOf)
  * Lockup parameters
  * Locked and unlocked token balances
  * The unlock function used to release available tokens
  * Administrative parameters related to transferability and global lockups
* **Important note for users:** If you believe you still have locked OBOL tokens from the airdrop, you can:
  * Verify that you hold an **ObolLockups NFT** at the address above.
  * Interact **directly with this contract on Etherscan** to call the unlock function.

For security reasons, users should **only** interact with the contract address listed here and not rely on token or NFT names alone.
