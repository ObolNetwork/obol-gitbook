# What is this API?

### What is this API?

This API is for creating and managing [Distributed Validators](https://docs.obol.tech/docs/int/key-concepts#distributed-validator). This API works in tandem with Obol's [Distributed Validator Launchpad](https://launchpad.obol.org), a dApp designed to allow people to authenticate their counterparties and agree to the terms of a Distributed Validator Cluster. This API can also be used via the [Obol-SDK](../sdk/index.md).

Read more about Obol and how to use the [launchpad](https://launchpad.obol.org) on our [docs site](https://docs.obol.tech/).
