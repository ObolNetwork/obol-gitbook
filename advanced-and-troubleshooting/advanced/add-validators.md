# Adding Validators

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is an experimental feature available starting with Charon v1.6 and should not be used in production (Mainnet) yet.
{% endhint %}

You can add validators to your cluster using the `charon alpha edit add-validators` command. The example below is designed for the default configuration provided by this repository and assumes that the stack uses the Lodestar validator client.

## Prerequisites

1. Review the `edit add-validators` command [CLI reference](../../learn/charon/charon-cli-reference.md#add-validators-to-a-cluster).
2. Keep the DV node running during the process and ensure you have a copy of the current cluster lock file and validator private key shares (or use `--unverified` if validator keys are not accessible).

{% hint style="info" %}
The ceremony uses a different p2p relay from your running cluster to avoid conflicts. The default relay address is already configured differently, so no special action is required.
{% endhint %}

## Adding Validators Process

The examples below are for adding 10 validators. You can use them with any number of validators you would like to add. Run the following command to collectively generate and add 10 new validators with other node operators (similar to DKG):

```bash
# If you prefer running a pre-built charon binary
charon alpha edit add-validators --num-validators 10 --withdrawal-addresses=0x<your_withdrawal_address> --fee-recipient-addresses=0x<your_fee_recipient_address> --output-dir=output

# Or, if you prefer running it in Docker
# (replace 'latest' with the most recent version if needed: https://hub.docker.com/r/obolnetwork/charon/tags)
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/charon" obolnetwork/charon:latest alpha edit add-validators --num-validators 10 --withdrawal-addresses=0x<your_withdrawal_address> --fee-recipient-addresses=0x<your_fee_recipient_address> --private-key-file=/opt/charon/.charon/charon-enr-private-key --lock-file=/opt/charon/.charon/cluster-lock.json --validator-keys-dir=/opt/charon/.charon/validator_keys --output-dir=/opt/charon/output
```

This command will create a new cluster configuration that includes both existing and new validators. It will also generate the necessary keys for the new validators and deposit data files. The new configuration will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Making the DV Stack Use the New Validators

The example below is designed for the [CDVN repository](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-node), but the process is similar for other setups.

1. To start using the new configuration (with the added validators), stop the current Charon and validator client instances:

```bash
docker compose stop charon lodestar
```

2. Back up and remove the existing `.charon` directory, then move the `output` directory to `.charon`:

```bash
mv .charon .charon-backup
mv output .charon
```

3. Restart the Charon and validator client instances:

```bash
docker compose up -d charon lodestar
```

Lodestar's boot script (`lodestar/run.sh`) will automatically import all keys, removing any existing keys and cache. Charon will load the new `cluster-lock.json` and recognise all validators in the cluster.

{% hint style="info" %}
Steps 1â€“3 must be performed independently by all node operators, likely at different times. During this process, some nodes will use the old configuration and others the new one. Once the number of upgraded nodes reaches the BFT threshold, the newly added validators will begin participating in the cluster.
{% endhint %}

## Current Limitations

- The new cluster configuration will not be reflected on the Launchpad.
- The new cluster configuration will have a new cluster hash, so the observability stack will display new cluster data under a different identifier.
- If Charon has no access to the existing validator keys (for example, if they're stored in a remote KeyManager), you must use the `--unverified` flag. This flag allows the addition to proceed but skips hashing and signing the new cluster lock data. When using this flag, you must start `charon run` with the `--no-verify` flag or set the `CHARON_NO_VERIFY=true` environment variable.
- If you use different validator clients, review the keys import script. The old keys in `.charon/validator_keys` remain unchanged, so verify that importing the same keys will not disrupt the validator client's state.
